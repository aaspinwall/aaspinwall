About me
--------

**I have been building web stuff since I was 11 years-old.** Starting with Geocities and evolving into a multifaceted career that spans across music, photography, sound engineering, electronic engineering, programming, video production, feature film post-production, VR games, and 3D sound.

**I thrive in dynamic environments and have not stopped evolving.** At Amazon, I've played a pivotal role in designing front end infrastructure, creating scalable solutions, and enhancing developer efficiency across multiple teams. My journey from a full-stack developer to a senior frontend engineer at Amazon and Nesto demonstrates a continuous growth path, where I've tackled challenges ranging from micro-frontend architecture to CI/CD pipeline optimization.

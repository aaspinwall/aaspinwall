## About me


**I have been building web stuff since I was 11 years-old**. Back in the day I tinkered endlessly with the site builder tool from Geocities and came up with a few sites where I could host the Flash animations I was making for my friends. When social media came around I was making myspace websites look stunning (15 year old me thought so) with my sick coding skills.

**Since then I haven't stopped learning and creating.** I have been involved in music, photography, sound engineering, electronic engineering, programming, video production, feature film post-production, VR games, and 3D sound.

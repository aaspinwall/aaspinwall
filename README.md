###My quick story

**I have been building web stuff since I was 11 years-old**. Back in the day I tinkered endlessly with the site builder tool from Geocities and came up with a few sites where I could host the Flash animations I was making for my friends. Later, the game changed and the cool stuff was made with Dreamweaver, so I used it to make fan-club websites for my favourite musicians. When social media came around I was making myspace websites look stunning (15 year old me thought so) with my sick coding skills.

**Since then I haven't stopped learning and creating.** I have been involved in music, photography, sound engineering, electronic engineering, programming, video production, feature film post-production, VR games, and 3D sound.

In the last few years, I have been increasingly working on software development in my professional life. I've been lucky to have worked alongside senior developers and designers, who have taught me what's expected from a quality product.
